1. **Naming:** The style of a name immediately informs us what sort of thing the named entity is: a type, a variable, a function, a constant, a macro, etc., without requiring us to search for the declaration of that entity. 
  - ***Names should be descriptive,*** Avoid abbreviation
	```
		int price_count_reader; // OK
		int pc_reader; 			// Bad
	```
  - ***File Names*** should be all lowercase and can include underscores (_) or dashes (-).
